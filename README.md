# interactive_user_defined_shell_in_c

Implement a shell which supports semi­colon separated list of commands. Use 
'​ strtok'  to tokenize the command. Also support '&' operator which lets a program run in 
background after printing the process id of the newly created process.  user defined interactive shell program so 
that it can handle background and foreground processes. It should also be able to handle 
input/output redirections and pipes .
The goal of the project is to create a user defined interactive shell program that can 
create and manage new processes. The shell should be able to create a process out of a 
system program like emacs, vi or any user­defined executable.
